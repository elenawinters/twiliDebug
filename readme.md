# Twili Debug - For FiveM/RedM

This is Twili Debug. It is my own tool that I use for development of my projects.


# Warning

While RedM is supported, it is quite restrictive in capability with some aspects of the debugging functions.
Do NOT use TwiliDebug's `twiliset render` objects if you are sensitivie to flashing lights when running this script on RedM.
For some reason, RedM can not handle the amount of DrawPoly calls being made by those functions.
